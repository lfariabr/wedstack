# CI/CD Implementation Guide

This guide explains how to set up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment for the backend application.

## 1. Set Up GitHub Repository

```bash
# Initialize git if you haven't already
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Initial commit with Docker and CI/CD setup"

# Add remote repository
git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 2. Configure GitHub Secrets

In your GitHub repository, go to Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions and add the following secrets:

- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: Your Docker Hub access token (create one at https://hub.docker.com/settings/security)
- `DEPLOY_HOST`: Your server's IP address or hostname
- `DEPLOY_USER`: SSH username for your server
- `DEPLOY_KEY`: SSH private key for accessing your server
- `DEPLOY_PATH`: Path to your application on the server (e.g., `/home/user/portfolio-backend`)
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT authentication
- `MONGO_USER`: MongoDB username
- `MONGO_PASSWORD`: MongoDB password
- `REDIS_PASSWORD`: Redis password
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key

## 3. GitHub Actions Workflow

Our workflow file (`.github/workflows/main.yml`) defines a pipeline with three stages:

1. **Test**: Runs your test suite to ensure code quality
2. **Build**: Builds and pushes a Docker image to Docker Hub
3. **Deploy**: Deploys the application to your production server

The workflow is triggered on push to main/master branches and on pull requests.

## 4. Deployment Process

The deployment process:
1. Pulls the latest Docker images
2. Creates `.env.production` if it doesn't exist
3. Updates environment variables from GitHub secrets
4. Starts the application using Docker Compose
5. Cleans up unused Docker resources

## 5. Monitoring Deployments

You can monitor your deployments in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository. Each workflow run will show the status of your tests, build, and deployment.

## 6. Manual Deployment

If you need to deploy manually, you can use:

```bash
# SSH into your server
ssh user@your-server

# Navigate to your application directory
cd /path/to/your/app

# Pull the latest image
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull

# Deploy
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# Clean up
docker system prune -af
```

## 7. Best Practices

- Keep secrets in GitHub Secrets, never in your code
- Use semantic versioning for your Docker images
- Implement proper monitoring and logging
- Consider setting up staging environments
- Add notifications for successful/failed deployments

## 8. Next Steps

- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Implement database backup and restore procedures
- Configure auto-scaling for production
- Set up a rollback strategy
