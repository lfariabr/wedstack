## 4. GraphQL Integration: Create specific queries and mutations to fetch data from backend
Replace placeholder data with actual API queries

1. We created queries for projects/articles, featured projects/articles, and a single project/article in src/lib/hooks/useProjects.ts and src/lib/hooks/useArticles.ts
2. We created graphql queries/fragments in src/graphql/queries/projects and src/graphql/queries/articles
3. We created Typescript interface for project data in src/lib/graphql/types/project.types.ts and src/lib/graphql/types/article.types.ts
4. We created page listing with all projects/articles in src/app/projects/page.tsx and src/app/articles/page.tsx
