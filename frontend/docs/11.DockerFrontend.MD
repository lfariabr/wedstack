# Dockerizing the Frontend

This document explains how the frontend application is containerized using Docker and integrated with the backend services through Docker Compose.

## Dockerfile Structure

The frontend Dockerfile uses a three-stage build approach for optimal image size, security, and dependency management:

```dockerfile
# Dependencies stage - handles package installation
FROM node:20-alpine AS deps

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY package.json package-lock.json* ./

# Install dependencies with force flag to bypass peer dependency conflicts
# This is necessary because React 19 conflicts with testing libraries
RUN npm install --force

# Builder stage - create production build
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy dependencies from deps stage
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .

# Next.js collects anonymous telemetry data - disable it
ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1

# Build the application
RUN npm run build

# Production stage - minimal runtime image
FROM node:20-alpine AS runner

WORKDIR /app

# Set environment variables
ENV NODE_ENV production
ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1

# Create non-root user for security
RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs && \
    adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs

# Copy only necessary files from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
COPY --from=builder /app/next.config.ts ./
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./package.json

# Copy the standalone output
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/standalone ./
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/static ./.next/static

# Use non-root user
USER nextjs

# Expose port
EXPOSE 3000

# Set host to allow connections from outside container
ENV PORT 3000
ENV HOSTNAME "0.0.0.0"

# Start the application
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

## Next.js Configuration

The `next.config.ts` file has been configured with several optimizations for containerization:

```typescript
import type { NextConfig } from "next";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  /* config options here */
  images: {
    domains: [
      'github.com',
      'raw.githubusercontent.com',
      'avatars.githubusercontent.com',
      'user-images.githubusercontent.com',
      'unsplash.com',
      'images.unsplash.com',
      'plus.unsplash.com',
    ],
  },
  output: 'standalone', // Enable standalone output for Docker deployment
  
  // Disable ESLint in production builds
  eslint: {
    // Only run ESLint in development, not during builds
    ignoreDuringBuilds: true,
  },
  
  // Disable TypeScript type checking during builds for faster builds
  typescript: {
    // Skip type checking during builds
    ignoreBuildErrors: true,
  },
};

export default nextConfig;
```

These settings:
- Enable standalone output mode to create a self-contained deployment package
- Disable ESLint during builds to avoid failing on non-critical style issues
- Skip TypeScript type checking during builds for faster build times
- Configure image domains for Next.js Image optimization

## Dependency Management

Our frontend uses React 19, which has peer dependency conflicts with some testing libraries. To address this:

1. We use a three-stage build approach to isolate dependency installation
2. Use the `--force` flag during installation to bypass conflicts
3. Keep testing dependencies out of the production image
4. Add a comprehensive `.dockerignore` file to exclude test files

## Health Check API

A health check API endpoint has been added at `/api/health` to support Docker's health check functionality:

```typescript
export async function GET() {
  return NextResponse.json({
    status: 'ok',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    uptime: process.uptime(),
    version: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION || '1.0.0',
    environment: process.env.NODE_ENV
  });
}
```

This endpoint enables Docker to monitor the application's health and automatically restart it if needed.

## Environment Variable Handling

Docker Compose handles environment variables as follows:

1. Variables defined in the `environment` section of docker-compose.yml are passed to the container
2. Host-level environment variables can be referenced using `${VARIABLE_NAME}` syntax
3. Default values can be provided using `${VARIABLE_NAME:-default_value}`

To properly configure environment variables:
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory (next to docker-compose.yml) for Docker Compose variables
- Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for variables that should be accessible in the browser

Example:
```bash
# .env (in project root)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

This will be picked up by Docker Compose and passed to the containers that need it.

## Docker Compose Integration

The frontend is integrated with the backend services using Docker Compose, which:

1. Orchestrates the startup sequence of services
2. Manages environment variables and networking
3. Provides health checks for reliability
4. Sets up persistent volumes for data storage

## Building and Running

To build and run the frontend with all required services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000

## Benefits of Docker Containerization

1. **Consistency**: Ensures the application runs the same way in all environments
2. **Isolation**: Each service runs in its own container with controlled dependencies
3. **Scalability**: Easy to scale horizontally in cloud environments
4. **Security**: Uses a non-root user and minimal production image
5. **Performance**: Optimized build process and runtime configuration
6. **Portability**: Can be deployed to any platform that supports Docker
