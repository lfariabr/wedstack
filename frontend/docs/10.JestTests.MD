## 10. Frontend Testing with Jest

We've implemented a comprehensive testing setup for the frontend using Jest and React Testing Library, following industry best practices and aligned with the Windsurf Engineering Manifesto.

### Testing Setup

1. **Jest Configuration**
   - Configured with TypeScript support via ts-jest
   - Set up for React/Next.js testing with jsdom environment
   - Module mapping for CSS, images, and path aliases
   - Coverage reporting for all TypeScript/JavaScript files

2. **Testing Utilities**
   - Custom render function with provider wrappers (Apollo, ThemeProvider)
   - Mock implementations for Next.js router and Image components
   - Utility functions for testing components with all necessary context

3. **Test Types**
   - **Component Tests**: Testing UI components for correct rendering and behavior
   - **Hook Tests**: Testing custom hooks with mocked Apollo responses
   - **Integration Tests**: Testing component interactions and state changes

### What's Covered

1. **UI Components**
   - Basic rendering and variant testing for UI components
   - Event handling (clicks, form submissions)
   - Accessibility and proper ARIA attributes

2. **Custom Hooks**
   - Testing data fetching with mocked GraphQL responses
   - Testing mutations and their side effects
   - Error handling and loading states

3. **Authentication**
   - Login/registration flows
   - Token handling and user session management
   - Protected route access

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode during development
npm run test:watch

# Generate test coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

The coverage report will be available in the `coverage` directory after running the coverage command.

### Best Practices

- Tests follow the AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Each test focuses on a single behavior or outcome
- Mock external dependencies to isolate the code being tested
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Keep tests independent and avoid test interdependencies

### Adding New Tests

To add new tests:

1. Create a `__tests__` directory in the component or hook directory
2. Name your test file with the `.test.tsx` or `.test.ts` extension
3. Import the component or hook you want to test
4. Use the provided utilities for rendering and testing
5. Follow existing patterns for mocking dependencies
