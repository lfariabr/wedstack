# Feature Qr Code Scaffolding
Goal: create a simple service to transform a link, on this case, https://wedstack.com/share-love, into a QR code that can be scanned by guests to access the share love page.

We will safely store the link's image credentials in mongoDB that we have set up and consume it from them.

On this file we'll document the step by step approach to fitting this into the existing codebase, displaying the versatility of the system I've engineered on the MERN stack.
